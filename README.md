# Vicon Pupil Integration for algorithmic gaze analysis

The purpose is to provide a step by step implementation of a PupilEyeTracker into a Vicon environment.
This readme contains three parts:  
Part 1: Setup for Vicon (Calibration, creating rigid body segments and tips for recording data).  
Part 2: Setup for Pupil (Attaching reflective markers to the glass, calibrating the position of the tracker in space and calibrating gaze)  
Part 3: Integration of movement data and gaze data. Here, measures from Vicon (movement data) and Pupil tracker (gaze data) are performed in Matlab. Follow the `integration.m` script to understand the calculations described here.

## Part 1: Setup for Vicon
Pending.
## Part 2: Setup for Pupil
Pending. 
## Part 3: Integration of movement data and gaze data
To understand the calculations performed in this part, open `integration.m` file in the repository. The description here follows the sections of the code in the Matlab script.

### Section: Make inventory of data directory
#### Saving the data in the correct folder structure
This script is flexible to take data for only one participant or for several. In this section, Matlab makes a list of all the participants and all their trials to perform all subsequent calculations.  
First, the filepath of the folder where the script is needs to be specified. Second, the filepath to the folder where the data is stored needs to be specified (as `DataDir`).  
Requirement here: `DataDir` needs to be organized in [this structure](Pending).  
#### For each participant, for each trial
There are two main loops happening in the analysis. On a high level, analysis starts for the first participant. When finished, the second participant is loaded. Within each participant, all the trials are loaded. The calculation starts with the first trial, when finished it moves to the next. This is seen in the two `for` loops (Cycle through all participants; Cycle through all trials of each participant).  
Before the actual loops start, Matlab creates an inventory of all the `c3d` files (Vicon), the `csv`files (Raw pupil export) and the `mat` files (imported Pupil files).  
Check the following variables in the script: The variables `*Trialnames_cell` should always contain a cell array with all the trials of the currently loaded participant.

## Pupil data extraction
### Data format general
- Source: [Pupil Docs](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/#data-format)
- Pupil data format for gaze vectors are using normalized space
- Origin 0,0 at the bottom left and 1,1 at the top right. This is the OpenGL convention 
 
### Data format "gaze_positions.csv"
- `gaze_timestamp` are timestamps in seconds. The number is usually really high, since it is the computer clock since last start. A timestamp of 6000 means that the computer was last restarted 6000 seconds ago. From this column, only the difference between each timeframe is of interest.
- For recordings of 120 Hz, one would expect delta timestamps of 1/120 s = 0.0083
- Looking into the actual data, a delta of 0.0040 was found, indicating a necessary interpolation ([See graph](https://imgur.com/fYKoSV3))
 





## Algorithm
### Calibration
- Subject stands in steady position, eye centered on calibration marker
- Start Vicon capture
- Get rotation from rigid body on first frame. This will be baseline yaw, pitch, and roll for world cordinates
- Start Pupil capture
- Set rotation of first frames to 0 (yaw and pitch of the eye)
- For each frame: Add the yaw and pitch of the eye to the rigid body rotation
